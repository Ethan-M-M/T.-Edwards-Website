      Thomas isn't just dedicated to his own success, he is also a champion for the success of others. I struggled for years, to break into the tech sector, but after meeting Thomas, he referred me to an open position with his employer. Three weeks later, I had an offer for my dream job. Since then, I've heard of several others that Thomas has helped. He is a person of great generosity and his good name carries tremendous value!

      As a cyber security instructor at the Eleven Fifty Academy, I had the opportunity to teach students about various aspects of cyber security, including ethical hacking, network security, and incident response. The academy was a great place to work, and I found the experience to be incredibly fulfilling. One student that stood out to me was Thomas Edwards. He was an exceptionally motivated and engaged learner, always eager to take on new challenges and learn new skills. I enjoyed collaborating with him on various assignments and projects throughout the course, and I was consistently impressed by his technical abilities and creativity. Overall, my time at the Eleven Fifty Academy was a highly positive experience. I felt honored to have been able to help prepare the next generation of cyber security professionals like Thomas, and I believe that the knowledge and skills that I was able to impart on my students will serve them well in their future careers.
